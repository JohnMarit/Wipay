# Vercel Deployment Fix for 404 Error

## Problem
The Wipay application was experiencing 404 errors when deployed to Vercel because the React Router's `BrowserRouter` was only enabled when users were authenticated. This caused issues when users:
- Accessed the site directly via URL
- Refreshed the page
- Tried to access specific routes

## Root Cause
The application structure had conditional routing:
- **Before authentication**: No router was present, only a login form
- **After authentication**: BrowserRouter was enabled

This meant that when Vercel tried to serve routes to unauthenticated users, there was no router to handle the routing, resulting in 404 errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Always Enable BrowserRouter
The app now always has `BrowserRouter` enabled regardless of authentication state:

```tsx
// Before (Problematic)
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return <LoginForm />; // No router here!
}

return (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);

// After (Fixed)
return (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={
        isAuthenticated ? <Dashboard /> : <LoginForm />
      } />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

### 2. Route-Level Authentication
Authentication is now handled at the route level:
- All routes check authentication state
- Unauthenticated users see the login form
- Authenticated users see the appropriate component

### 3. Proper Fallback Routes
Added proper fallback for all routes:
```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/login" element={<LoginComponent />} />
  <Route path="/" element={
    isAuthenticated ? <Index /> : <LoginComponent />
  } />
  <Route path="*" element={
    isAuthenticated ? <NotFound /> : <LoginComponent />
  } />
</Routes>
```

## Vercel Configuration
The `vercel.json` configuration is correctly set up for SPA routing:

```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "wipay",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified
1. **`src/App.tsx`** - Restructured to always have BrowserRouter enabled
2. **`vercel.json`** - Already correctly configured (no changes needed)

## Testing
The application should now work correctly when:
1. Accessing the root URL (`/`)
2. Refreshing the page
3. Accessing any route directly
4. Navigating between routes

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push the changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. The 404 error should be resolved

## Key Benefits
- ✅ No more 404 errors on direct URL access
- ✅ Page refresh works correctly
- ✅ All routes are properly handled
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Proper SPA behavior maintained

The fix ensures that the React Router is always present to handle routing, while authentication is managed at the component level within the routes.
